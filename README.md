# Next-Gen Web Development Manifesto

## Our Vision
We envision a web where applications are reliable, secure, and free from the preventable errors that plague modern development. The next generation of web development demands a paradigm shift: a rejection of fragile, error-prone languages and an embrace of robust, strongly typed systems that eliminate entire classes of bugs. We build for a future where developers trust their tools, users trust their apps, and the web fulfills its promise as a universal platform.

## The Problem
JavaScript, the web’s default language, is fundamentally unfit for modern development due to its weak typing, implicit coercions, and runtime errors that breed instability. TypeScript, marketed as a solution, falls critically short of the strong type system required for next-gen web development. It fails to address JavaScript’s unsafe array access, allowing out-of-bounds errors to persist. Null safety is incomplete, relying on developers to manually specify nullable types—DOM access, for instance, remains a minefield of potential null errors. Structural typing creates semantic loopholes, permitting unsafe assumptions about object shapes. Implicit type conversions are still allowed, undermining predictability. Worst of all, TypeScript lacks exhaustive type checking, leaving gaps in logic that lead to runtime failures. These shortcomings make TypeScript a fragile patch, not a foundation for reliable server-side rendering (SSR) or client-side rendering (CSR) applications. The web demands languages that guarantee correctness, not ones that merely suggest it.

## Our Principles: The Strong Type System
We define a strongly typed language by these non-negotiable features, which form the foundation of next-gen web development:

1. **Type Safety**: Invalid operations on types are impossible, with errors caught at compile-time, not runtime.
2. **Static Type Checking**: Type rules are enforced before execution, ensuring variables and expressions adhere to declared types.
3. **No Implicit Type Coercion**: Automatic type conversions are banned, preventing unexpected behavior.
4. **Expressive Type Constructs**: Algebraic data types, pattern matching, and type inference enable precise modeling of complex data.
5. **Compile-Time Null Safety**: Null or undefined values are handled explicitly, eliminating null-pointer errors.
6. **Exhaustive Matching**: All possible cases in pattern matching must be handled, ensuring complete logic.
7. **Type Inference**: Types are deduced automatically where possible, reducing boilerplate without sacrificing safety.
8. **Soundness**: The type system guarantees no type-related errors escape to runtime.
9. **Safe Array/Bounds Checking**: Array accesses are validated at compile-time or runtime, preventing crashes.

These principles are not optional—they are the minimum standard for languages that power the next generation of web applications.

## Our Commitments
- **Mandate Type-Safe Technologies**: We urge leadership to prioritize strongly typed languages for SSR and CSR applications, ensuring robust, bug-free systems that reduce maintenance costs and enhance user trust.
- **Phase Out JavaScript as a Primary Language**: We commit to transitioning JavaScript to a compilation target (e.g., WebAssembly output), minimizing its risks and aligning with scalable, type-safe architectures.
- **Reject TypeScript’s Half-Measures**: We advocate retiring TypeScript in favor of languages with sound type systems, mitigating the risks of its unsound types and runtime errors that jeopardize mission-critical applications.
- **Invest in Developer Productivity and Reliability**: We pledge to adopt tools that catch errors at compile-time, streamline debugging, and boost team efficiency, delivering measurable ROI through faster development cycles and fewer production issues.
- **Future-Proof Organizational Strategy**: We commit to building web platforms with languages like Rust or Elm, ensuring long-term stability, security, and competitiveness in an evolving digital landscape.

## Call to Action
The web stands at a pivotal moment. We, the leaders, strategists, and decision-makers of the next generation, must champion tools that deliver reliability and trust. Mandate languages like Rust or Elm that uphold our principles. Invest in WebAssembly to transcend JavaScript’s flaws. Promote frameworks that prioritize type safety. Lead, innovate, and commit to a web built on certainty. The next-gen web begins with your vision. Let’s build it right.
