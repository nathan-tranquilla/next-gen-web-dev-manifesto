# Next-Gen Web Development Manifesto

## Our Vision
We envision a web where applications are reliable, secure, and free from the preventable errors that plague modern development. The next generation of web development demands a paradigm shift: a rejection of fragile, error-prone languages and an embrace of robust, strongly typed systems that eliminate entire classes of bugs. We build for a future where developers trust their tools, users trust their apps, and the web fulfills its promise as a universal platform.

## The Problem
JavaScript, the web’s default language, is fundamentally unfit for modern development due to its weak typing, implicit coercions, and runtime errors that breed instability. TypeScript, marketed as a solution, falls critically short of the strong type system required for next-gen web development. It fails to address JavaScript’s unsafe array access, allowing out-of-bounds errors to persist. Null safety is incomplete, relying on developers to manually specify nullable types—DOM access, for instance, remains a minefield of potential null errors. Structural typing creates semantic loopholes, permitting unsafe assumptions about object shapes. Implicit type conversions are still allowed, undermining predictability. Worst of all, TypeScript lacks exhaustive type checking, leaving gaps in logic that lead to runtime failures. These shortcomings make TypeScript a fragile patch, not a foundation for reliable server-side rendering (SSR) or client-side rendering (CSR) applications. The web demands languages that guarantee correctness, not ones that merely suggest it.

## Our Principles: The Strong Type System
We define a strongly typed language by these non-negotiable features, which form the foundation of next-gen web development:

1. **Type Safety**: Invalid operations on types are impossible, with errors caught at compile-time, not runtime.
2. **Static Type Checking**: Type rules are enforced before execution, ensuring variables and expressions adhere to declared types.
3. **No Implicit Type Coercion**: Automatic type conversions are banned, preventing unexpected behavior.
4. **Expressive Type Constructs**: Algebraic data types, pattern matching, and type inference enable precise modeling of complex data.
5. **Compile-Time Null Safety**: Null or undefined values are handled explicitly, eliminating null-pointer errors.
6. **Exhaustive Matching**: All possible cases in pattern matching must be handled, ensuring complete logic.
7. **Type Inference**: Types are deduced automatically where possible, reducing boilerplate without sacrificing safety.
8. **Soundness**: The type system guarantees no type-related errors escape to runtime.
9. **Safe Array/Bounds Checking**: Array accesses are validated at compile-time or runtime, preventing crashes.

These principles are not optional—they are the minimum standard for languages that power the next generation of web applications.

## Our Commitments
- **Reject JavaScript as a Development Language**: JavaScript is relegated to a compilation target, the output of strongly typed languages compiled to WebAssembly or other safe runtimes.
- **Move Beyond TypeScript**: TypeScript’s compromises—its unsound types and JavaScript runtime—disqualify it from next-gen web development.
- **Restrict SSR and CSR to Strongly Typed Languages**: Only languages meeting our strong type system criteria are suitable for building modern web applications, ensuring consistency and reliability across server and client.
- **Champion Developer Empowerment**: We prioritize tools that catch errors early, reduce debugging, and free developers to focus on creating, not fixing.
- **Build for Scale and Safety**: From startups to enterprises, our approach eliminates bugs that scale with complexity, delivering apps users can trust.

## Call to Action
The web is at a crossroads. We, the developers, architects, and visionaries of the next generation, must demand more from our tools. Adopt languages like Rust, Elm, or others that embody our principles. Experiment with WebAssembly to break free from JavaScript’s limitations. Advocate for frameworks and ecosystems that prioritize type safety. Teach, share, and build with strong typing at the core.

Together, we will redefine web development—not as a patchwork of fixes, but as a foundation of certainty. The next-gen web starts with us. Let’s code it right.
