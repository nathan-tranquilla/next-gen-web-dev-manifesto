# Next-Gen Web Development Manifesto

## Vision
We aim for a web where applications are reliable, secure, and free from preventable errors. Next-gen web development requires a shift to robust, strongly typed languages that eliminate entire classes of bugs, ensuring developers trust their tools and users trust their apps.

## The Problem
JavaScript’s weak typing, implicit coercions, and runtime errors make it unsuitable for modern web development. TypeScript, while an improvement, falls short of a strong type system. It permits unsafe array access, lacks full null safety, allows implicit conversions, and misses exhaustive type checking. These flaws make it inadequate for reliable server-side (SSR) or client-side (CSR) applications. The web needs languages that guarantee correctness, not just suggest it.

## Principles: Strong Type System
A strongly typed language must include:
1. **Type Safety**: Invalid operations are caught at compile-time.
2. **Static Type Checking**: Types are enforced before execution.
3. **No Implicit Coercion**: Automatic conversions are prohibited.
4. **Expressive Types**: Algebraic data types and pattern matching for precise data modeling.
5. **Compile-Time Null Safety**: Explicit handling of null/undefined.
6. **Exhaustive Matching**: All cases in logic must be covered.
7. **Type Inference**: Automatic type deduction without compromising safety.
8. **Soundness**: No type errors at runtime.
9. **Safe Array Access**: Bounds checking to prevent crashes.

These are the minimum requirements for next-gen web languages.

## Commitments
- **Adopt Type-Safe Languages**: Prioritize strongly typed languages for SSR and CSR to reduce bugs and maintenance costs.
- **Reduce JavaScript’s Role**: Transition JavaScript to a compilation target (e.g., WebAssembly) for safer, scalable systems.
- **Move Beyond TypeScript**: Replace TypeScript with languages offering sound type systems to minimize runtime errors.
- **Enhance Productivity**: Use tools that catch errors at compile-time to streamline development and improve reliability.
- **Build for the Future**: Embrace languages like Rust or Elm for stable, secure, and competitive web platforms.

## Call to Action
The web’s future depends on reliable tools. Leaders must champion strongly typed languages, invest in WebAssembly, and promote type-safe frameworks. Build a web grounded in certainty with languages like Rust or Elm. The next-gen web starts now—let’s make it robust.
